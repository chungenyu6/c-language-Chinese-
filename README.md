  Term Project : C Programming Language (Basic-level)
</h1>

## Notice
- These are the assignments from **C Programming Language Course**, and the copyright of the questions 
belongs to the original author(professor). I only offer the code solutions, and these codes are 
all for education purpose, but if there are any issues with the authorization, please contact me, 
I will immediately remove it.

- All the comments in the code and the problem statement (named `ProblemStatement.md`) was written in Mandarin.
- My source code only complete most of the rules (but not all) that states in `ProblemStatement.md`
